      <p><strong>I</strong> \\ They put up a couple of those big white tents for the refugees from the war. There's a steep ravine covered in moss and trees next to it with a creek running through. The refugees tend to hang out down there a bit, its a nice area I suppose. There aren't any bus stops by the tents, since its in a weird industrial area along a wide but seldom used frontage road. They really need to put in a bus stop there. Because the folks there are now always having to walk half a mile along that frontage road that doesn't have a sidewalk all the way to the Shell gas station and up the other street to the nearest bus stop. Inconvenient for them and for anyone else trying to drive around that area. It's just unsafe. I understand that that's a piece of county property where they could put the shelters but can't the county do something about the buses too? Who's in charge of this stuff?

<p><strong>II</strong> \\ So there's the new type of fish I've seen. And buried under the organic spongy soil are stainless steel plates. Rust free but a little dinged up. They've got rivets or bolt heads or something along them where there must be seams. I haven't found two corners yet that I can say are on the same panel but I guess they're maybe ten feet wide at least. Maybe square or a rectangle with ten feet being the shorter of the two sides. I don't know about steel plate manufacturing to know if that's a standard size or not. But these things are all over the place if you dig down enough. Or like me just see them where the dirt has washed away after a big rain storm. I haven't actually dug down to find one myself. I don't have a shovel and even if I did It would be seriously conspicuous if I just started digging out somewhere especially if I don't know how deep the nearest plates are. Most of the ones I've seen exposed are next to roadways or other solid surfaces so I'm guessing they're not beneath the road too, the road is enough of a barrier itself I guess.
The seams are busted up enough that I think a crowbar could pry one open. Again, I don't have a crowbar and don't want to be busted by someone seeing me wailing away in the dirt somewhere. But suppose I could get one of those panels open and pried up enough to see past it. I'd need a flashlight because they don't have lights down there. 
And it's all water anyways, but I bet there's a big head space between the top of the water and the plates. But maybe the water level varies when it rains and stuff because from what I've seen its not air or water tight so it must seep into and maybe even out of there. A flashlight and a long stick or pole or something to gauge water depth. Maybe a rope with a heavy weight tied on one end. A rope marked off with knots for every X amount of feet or something. I don't think I'd need more than 50 feet or so of rope. It can't be too deep honestly. The fish stay near the top anyways because maybe they eat bugs that crawl their way through the dirt and into there. There's got to be a busted up plate somewhere the dirt can fall in and the water can push out because that's how I found the fish just in the dirt probably pushed out with the water in a big rain storm and flopped its way around in the dirt and grass and bushes. The bugs and maybe even rats or something had gotten to it like in its eyes and stuff before I saw it but it wasn't long dead. I mean it smelled fishy and everything still even with all the dirt and wet smell. The water is freshwater not saltwater so it doesn't have that ocean smell more like a swamp or stagnant pond smell so kind of musty but not completely unpleasant.
Someone must stock the fish down there because I can't imagine how they got in. Well if one can get out then they must be able to get in I suppose. So maybe nobody's stocking them. Maybe they only live around here where there's a busted plate.

<p><strong>III</strong> \\ There are at least four stones in this valley. They're parallel marking out a line north to south and the other two directly east to west but I haven't checked if at the intersection of the lines formed by the two pairs if there's a central stone but I doubt it. I bet there are more stones in all the bushes and trees and swampy parts that I can't get to really easily without bushwhacking or wading through muck.
They probably weren't in those orientations originally. I mean obviously originally they're from inside the earth but I mean when people found them and moved them. I think one of each pair has been moved and the other one is just where it is. So if one of each was moved then you could for sure make sure they make lines north to south and east to west but maybe that was unintentional because the roads go that way too so if you're moving rocks out of the way of a road or putting it next to a read they'd end up that way too.
They're quite different in size. Each pair has one really big stone that's maybe at least 15 feet at its biggest dimension. Then the other ones are more rounded and like 5 feet. I'm not counting whatever is buried in the ground but it doesn't quite look like much. They're worn to different degrees and honestly have different patterns and colors and textures even. I can't get close to one of them but the other ones I can get right up to.
Well you can climb all over them like I see kids doing to the biggest ones. Climbing rocks is always fun and probably why they're put there. Two of them are up in the southeast side of the valley kind of perched mid way between the valley floor and the top of the east ridge. The other two are smack in the bottom of the north part of the valley, well actually just to the east of the creek that runs down the middle of the valley.
I'll put them on the map.

<p><strong>IV</strong> \\ I haven't given the full picture yet. So the valley has a creek running from south to north where it meets a wetland with another larger stream of water from the north that then takes all the water east. The bottom of the valley has lots of wetlands and maples and alders and cottonwoods. The slopes have maples and alders but then some cedars and firs here and there mostly once when you get to the tops of the hills that bound the valley on east and west and south. And I sort of lied, there aren't just four stones there are lots but they're buried or I can't see them. I've only just counted the four. Below the valley floor the bedrock must be so deep. The ridges aren't even bedrock, they're piles of gravel and sand topped in topsoil. That's why the stones are so interesting.
Except now that I think of it, I have seen a fifth stone. Its also on the slopes of the eastern ridge. It's half buried if I remember correctly and pretty dazzling white with black flecks but really most notable when the leaves have fallen of the trees so that the sunlight can actually light up the white stone. It's probably more than half buried I only remember seeing a small dome of it rising from soil.
So after adding these to the map I draw the lines to connect them. The pair east to west, then the pair north to south. Then the fifth alone. It probably has another half to its pair somewhere I just need to find it. Its not at the intersection of the two other pair's lines is it?
My mind has a thin fishing line like one of those transparent ones you can barely see unless the light is just right and you see a flash of reflection along its length. This line goes back two decades or so, like there is a lag from now to then. So I'm here now but my minds back then too and it's tethered together. But that line is probably just one line in a whole net or web or mess of lines that got tangled way back. But it's back two decades. I can see the one decade mark clearly its here on the desk really in front of me. But two decades back its foggier. That's where the tangled net mess must be, between one and two decades ago. When two decades ago tugs on the line I can feel it today and all those waves and patterns from then are remembered because they're just now happening back then.

<p><strong>V</strong> \\ So there is no vast underground reservoir here. I've traversed the north end of the valley up to the northwest ridge and back down. I've also explored further the southwest ridge. There are no metal plates hidden beneath the soil. Its soil and rock all through. I was mistaken. The only underground networks consist of the haphazard grids of pipework, storm drains, and crypted streams under asphalt roofs. As for the fish, they're probably not there either. I was mistaken.

<p><strong>VI</strong> \\ Spoke to a next window neighbor to ask about all the dryness but they didn't know what was going on, but they weren't even there then were they. Window shoppers don't like the new neighbors in the camp up the street, but window shoppers in the town don't like anyone else but themselves. I asked the next window neighbor about the sky's openness but they have no opinion. There's not much openness left, most notable at night with the sat-trains blighting up the starfield like a morse code firework. Its all space junk and soon enough air junk and dirt junk and water junk we can just eat up the rare earth and hydrocarbons or flourocarbons or hexa-choloro-cyanide-stuff. Casting a dozen runes in the wind for it to end.

<p><strong>VII</strong> \\ There was finally a bout of warm weather. Around the wetlands here, out of the scraggly trees and snags and probably the fully leafed out maples now, small bats darted about. They were black against the darkening blue sky. Few clouds that evening were still illuminated by the sun over the horizon, and a few dim stars peeked out.
