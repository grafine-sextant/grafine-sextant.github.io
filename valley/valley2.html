<p><strong>III</strong> \\ There are at least four stones in this valley. They're parallel marking out a line north to south and the other two directly east to west but I haven't checked if at the intersection of the lines formed by the two pairs if there's a central stone but I doubt it. I bet there are more stones in all the bushes and trees and swampy parts that I can't get to really easily without bushwhacking or wading through muck.
They probably weren't in those orientations originally. I mean obviously originally they're from inside the earth but I mean when people found them and moved them. I think one of each pair has been moved and the other one is just where it is. So if one of each was moved then you could for sure make sure they make lines north to south and east to west but maybe that was unintentional because the roads go that way too so if you're moving rocks out of the way of a road or putting it next to a read they'd end up that way too.
They're quite different in size. Each pair has one really big stone that's maybe at least 15 feet at its biggest dimension. Then the other ones are more rounded and like 5 feet. I'm not counting whatever is buried in the ground but it doesn't quite look like much. They're worn to different degrees and honestly have different patterns and colors and textures even. I can't get close to one of them but the other ones I can get right up to.
Well you can climb all over them like I see kids doing to the biggest ones. Climbing rocks is always fun and probably why they're put there. Two of them are up in the southeast side of the valley kind of perched mid way between the valley floor and the top of the east ridge. The other two are smack in the bottom of the north part of the valley, well actually just to the east of the creek that runs down the middle of the valley.
I'll put them on the map.
