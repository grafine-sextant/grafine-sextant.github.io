      <p><strong>I</strong> \\ They put up a couple of those big white tents for the refugees from the war. There's a steep ravine covered in moss and trees next to it with a creek running through. The refugees tend to hang out down there a bit, its a nice area I suppose. There aren't any bus stops by the tents, since its in a weird industrial area along a wide but seldom used frontage road. They really need to put in a bus stop there. Because the folks there are now always having to walk half a mile along that frontage road that doesn't have a sidewalk all the way to the Shell gas station and up the other street to the nearest bus stop. Inconvenient for them and for anyone else trying to drive around that area. It's just unsafe. I understand that that's a piece of county property where they could put the shelters but can't the county do something about the buses too? Who's in charge of this stuff?

<p><strong>II</strong> \\ So there's the new type of fish I've seen. And buried under the organic spongy soil are stainless steel plates. Rust free but a little dinged up. They've got rivets or bolt heads or something along them where there must be seams. I haven't found two corners yet that I can say are on the same panel but I guess they're maybe ten feet wide at least. Maybe square or a rectangle with ten feet being the shorter of the two sides. I don't know about steel plate manufacturing to know if that's a standard size or not. But these things are all over the place if you dig down enough. Or like me just see them where the dirt has washed away after a big rain storm. I haven't actually dug down to find one myself. I don't have a shovel and even if I did It would be seriously conspicuous if I just started digging out somewhere especially if I don't know how deep the nearest plates are. Most of the ones I've seen exposed are next to roadways or other solid surfaces so I'm guessing they're not beneath the road too, the road is enough of a barrier itself I guess.</p>
<p>The seams are busted up enough that I think a crowbar could pry one open. Again, I don't have a crowbar and don't want to be busted by someone seeing me wailing away in the dirt somewhere. But suppose I could get one of those panels open and pried up enough to see past it. I'd need a flashlight because they don't have lights down there. </p>
<p>And it's all water anyways, but I bet there's a big head space between the top of the water and the plates. But maybe the water level varies when it rains and stuff because from what I've seen its not air or water tight so it must seep into and maybe even out of there. A flashlight and a long stick or pole or something to gauge water depth. Maybe a rope with a heavy weight tied on one end. A rope marked off with knots for every X amount of feet or something. I don't think I'd need more than 50 feet or so of rope. It can't be too deep honestly. The fish stay near the top anyways because maybe they eat bugs that crawl their way through the dirt and into there. There's got to be a busted up plate somewhere the dirt can fall in and the water can push out because that's how I found the fish just in the dirt probably pushed out with the water in a big rain storm and flopped its way around in the dirt and grass and bushes. The bugs and maybe even rats or something had gotten to it like in its eyes and stuff before I saw it but it wasn't long dead. I mean it smelled fishy and everything still even with all the dirt and wet smell. The water is freshwater not saltwater so it doesn't have that ocean smell more like a swamp or stagnant pond smell so kind of musty but not completely unpleasant.</p>
<p>Someone must stock the fish down there because I can't imagine how they got in. Well if one can get out then they must be able to get in I suppose. So maybe nobody's stocking them. Maybe they only live around here where there's a busted plate.Â
